C# Memory.dll based program to dynamicaly edit memory of seeelectrical process to allow a single license being used multiples time at once.
Open Config.ini to change parameters.
This project is not meant for continuous developpement (since there is bugs that avoid the program to behave as it should i will fix it).
09/07/2024 : Private Release. Public soon ...
12/07/2024 : Version 1.1 Major changes : 
                        -Geting the licence Number manualy is not needed anymore (First ever run should be working !)
                        -Setting a proper waiting time for the process to start is also not needed anymore : the program is now "Array of Bytes" scanning every 50 ms (Watch out to low end PC configs ! )
                        -Config.ini file is still used to locate binaries from SeeElectrical (DO NOT EDIT THE LICENSE NUMBER PARAM OTHERWISE THE PROGRAM MAY NOT WORK PROPERLY, THE PROGRAM IS WRITING IT BY ITSELF)
                        -Re-Writing code for <Win10 as been aborted (too much time for not that much)
                        -Built in Debug Form coming soon ... ( a Cheat Engine-like program)
